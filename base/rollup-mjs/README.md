This configuration assumes that the developer works with a modern browser, compatible with mjs modules and dynamic import `import("...")`, additionally offers optional support to Typescript

> If your browser does not support dynamic import, consider using as polyfill [Shimport](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/shimport).

> this configuration has been generated by `npm init @atomico`
